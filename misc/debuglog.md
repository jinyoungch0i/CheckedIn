# DebugLog

This is a working documentation of currently-existent bugs that need to be addressed in order for CheckedIn to function in its full capacity.

The list is organised in the order of priority.


### No time input 

This is a functionality that will be implemented. This was brought to the author's awareness upon iterations after iterations.

### When page reloads/refreshes, the daysLeft function needs to do a recalculation from the current date (not the date on which the card was created)

e.g. if the user submitted the profile today for a duedate of 'tomorrow', daysLeft should display 'today' if the user goes on and refreshes CheckedIn tomorrow. Currently, daysLeft is a static variable that needs to be updated every time the user is accessing CheckedIn.

**This will have to come in the form of defining and calling a function upon page reload (or new session), that checks the session/reload date/timestamp with that of the user-inputed checkInBy date variable.**

### Once the number of cards become greater than 8, the responsiveness fails. (on MacBookPro 13 inch) 

One way to mitigate this would be to do flex wrap, and make sure that after 8 entries, the 9th card will start from the row below, and so on.

### Update functionality is missing

I, the author, have been approaching the development of CheckedIn as a heuristic process. As soon as I get around to learning how to edit cards (for which the functionality will be integrated into the app.js script), update will be a live functionality.

### Increasing FAQ input accesibility to non-tech savvy user 

Currently the FAQ is written into the README.md document of the project's root directory. In order to increase the accesibility to FAQ (and also to encourage all users to provide feedback), there will be a visible 'FAQ' hyperlink somewhere in the header section of the CheckedIn platform. 

### Cards should always sort display by order of CheckInDate

This would be a better way of organising the CheckedIn contacts, in order to imply a sense of urgency towards those who are past due.  

### Allow users to press `esc` on keyboard to close modalbox

This will be integrated soon enough!
